description: The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The novel virus was first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019; a lockdown there and in other cities in surrounding Hubei failed to contain the outbreak. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Multiple variants of the virus emerged, led by the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron variants. As of 14 December 2021, more than 271 million cases and 5.31 million deaths have been confirmed, making the pandemic one of the deadliest in history.

## COVID-19 pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The novel virus was first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019; a lockdown there and in other cities in surrounding Hubei failed to contain the outbreak. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Multiple variants of the virus emerged, led by the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron variants. As of 14 December 2021, more than 271 million cases and 5.31 million deaths have been confirmed, making the pandemic one of the deadliest in history.

COVID-19 symptoms range from none to life-threatening. Severe illness is more likely in elderly patients and those with certain underlying medical conditions. COVID-19 is airborne, spread via air contaminated by microscopic particles. The risk of infection is highest among people in close proximity, but can occur over longer distances, particularly indoors in poorly ventilated areas. Transmission can also occur, albeit rarely, via contaminated surfaces or fluids. Infected persons can remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even without symptoms.

Vaccines have been approved and distributed in various countries. Mass vaccination campaigns began in December 2020. Other recommended preventive measures include social distancing, wearing face masks in public, ventilation/air-filtering, covering one's mouth when sneezing or coughing, hand washing, disinfecting surfaces, and quarantining those who have been exposed or are symptomatic. Treatments focus on addressing symptoms, but work is underway to develop antiviral medications. Governmental interventions include travel restrictions, lockdowns, business closures, workplace hazard controls, testing protocols, and tracing contacts of the infected. 

The pandemic triggered severe social and economic disruption around the world, including the largest global recession since the Great Depression.[6] Widespread supply shortages were caused by panic buying, supply chain disruption, and food shortages. The resultant near-global lockdowns saw an unprecedented decrease in the emission of pollutants. Numerous educational institutions and public areas were partially or fully closed, and many events were cancelled or postponed. Misinformation circulated through social media and mass media, and political tensions intensified. The pandemic has raised issues of racial and geographic discrimination, health equity, and the balance between public health imperatives and individual rights. 

### Etymology
The pandemic is known by several names. It is often referred to as its colloquial name, "the coronavirus pandemic",[7] despite the existence of other human coronaviruses that have caused epidemics and outbreaks (e.g. SARS).[8]

During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus", "Wuhan coronavirus",[9] "the coronavirus outbreak" and the "Wuhan coronavirus outbreak"[10] with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia".[11][12] In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV[13] and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease[14] as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g. Wuhan, China), animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent social stigma.[15] The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020.[16] Tedros Adhanom explained: CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified (31 December 2019).[17] The WHO additionally uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.[16]

Virus variants are also known by multiple names. Initially, they were commonly named after where the variants were identified (e.g. Delta variant was known as the Indian variant).[18] A more systematic naming scheme reflected the variant's PANGO lineage (e.g., Omicron's lineage is B.1.1.529). At the end of May 2021, the WHO introduced a policy of using Greek letters for variants of concern and variants of interest.[19][20][21] 

## Epidemiology
Background
Main articles: Investigations into the origin of COVID-19 and COVID-19 pandemic in Hubei

Although the exact origin of the virus is still unknown,[22] the first known outbreak started in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in November 2019. Many early cases of COVID-19 were linked to people who had visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan,[23][24][25] but it is possible that human-to-human transmission was happening before this.[26][27] SARS-CoV-2 is a newly discovered virus that is closely related to bat coronaviruses,[28] pangolin coronaviruses,[29][30] and SARS-CoV.[31]

The scientific consensus is that the virus is most likely of zoonotic origin, from bats or another closely-related mammal.[26][32] Despite this, the subject has generated extensive speculation.[33][27][34] The origin controversy heightened geopolitical divisions, notably between the United States and China.[35]

The earliest known infected person fell ill on 1 December 2019. That person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.[36][37] However, an earlier case may have occurred on 17 November.[38] Two-thirds of the initial case cluster were linked with the market.[39][40][41] Molecular clock analysis suggests that the index case is likely to have been infected between mid-October and mid-November 2019.[42][43]
